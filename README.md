Here is a Balatro Joker featuring Dingle the Alien from Twitch.TV/Taylien

The joker gives you a flat multiplier to your hand mult. 
Everytime you play a FLUSH it goes up 0.1x 
However, when you play a STRAIGHT, it goes down 0.1x 

Its a rare card as it can be VERY strong.
It can make the game very easy, but its intended as a joke :) 


Thanks
