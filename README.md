Here is a Balatro Joker featuring Dingle the Alien from Twitch.TV/Taylien

                         .-.
          .-""`""-.    |(@ @)
       _/`oOoOoOoOo`\_ \ \-/
      '.-=-=-=-=-=-=-.' \/ \
        `-=.=-.-=.=-'    \ /\
           ^  ^  ^       _H_ \


The joker gives you a flat multiplier to your hand mult. 
Everytime you play a FLUSH it goes up 0.1x.
However, when you play a STRAIGHT, it goes down 0.1x 

Its a rare card as it can be VERY strong.
It can make the game very easy, but its intended as a joke :) 

To install you need 3 things: (assuming you have no other mods)

1. [LOVELY](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector)     Put this into your main game directory
2. Go to your saves folder by typing "%appdata%\Balatro" into your file explorer and create a "Mods" folder
3. [SteamModded/SMOD](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods)   Put this into the new Mods Folder
4. Create a folder inside your mods called "DingleMod" and place this files into that.
5. PROFIT? DINGLE?

Thanks
